# Image Style Transfer Using CNN
* Implemented neural image style transfer using convolutional neural network.
* Based on a paper <em>Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks<em> by Gatyes et al.(https://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
* Used Pytorch
* Replaced the backbone structure from VGG19 to ResNet18.
